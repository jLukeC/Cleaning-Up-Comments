# Cleaning up Comments
This repository contains all code and experiments behind my paper [Cleaning Up Comments](/Cleaning_Up_Comments_Research_Paper.pdf).


## Directory Structure
`visuals/`  - All graphs and images generated by the notebooks are saved to this folder.

`submissions/`  - Contains all model outputs.

`models/` - The highest performing deep learning models are saved here.

`data/` - The location of the training and test data

The notebooks are split into three types:

## Data Analysis
- Initial Data Analysis

## Models
- naive_bayes.py
- Naive Bayes Logistic Regression
- LSTM Sentence Classification
- Bidirectional LSTM Sentence Classification

## Evaulation
- Analyze Model Outputs
- Error Analysis


## Setup
Necessary libraries: for this project I used `python3` with `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib/pyplot`, `sklearn`, and `keras`.
